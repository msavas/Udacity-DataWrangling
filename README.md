# Overview

This is a project submission for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree. The objective was to wrangle three data sets to allow for an analysis of them. The jupyter notebook file demonstrates the three key steps of data wrangling, as explained below.

## Gather
The project uses 3 data sets, which were gathered in the following ways: 
  * csv file provied by Udacity
  * Image file that was programmatically downloaded
  * Twitter data gathered using Twitter's API

 
## Assess 
  * Quality
  * Tidiness
  

## Clean
For each step of cleaning, I used the following steps
* Define
* Code
* Test

## Final Notes
Finally, I executed a simple analysis to demonstrate that the wrangling was sufficiently robust to allow for it.

Attached are two PDF reports that contain my reflections on the wrangling process and the aforementioned analysis.
